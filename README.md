## Data:
Agricultural Data comes from USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service's Quick Stats Database. It is open for public usage. I retrieved my data via an API.

Climate data comes from the National Centers for Environmental Information's Climate Data Online system. It is also open for public use. 

To generate the data used by the map, the user must execute the 'data_processing.py' file. This file will generate the geojson files and place them in the viz folder.
