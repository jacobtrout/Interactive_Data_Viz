## Description  
This project explores the relationship between agricultural productivity and climate change in the U.S. Midwest. The core deliverable is an interactive website that visualizes these trends at the county level.

The site allows users to explore how long-term changes in temperature and precipitation relate to crop yield trends using interactive maps and graphs.

The website is built with **D3.js** and hosted on **Netlify**.
