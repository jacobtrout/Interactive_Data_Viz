# Interactive Proposal

## Author: Jacob Trout

## Description and Data Sources
This project will be a continuation of my static project. I want to focus on the geospatial componenents of agriculture and climate in the midwest with a larger interactive map to present some of the same data I did in the static project.

Same sources as static project.

NASS Quick Stats Data The NASS has annual data from the agricultural survey on production of all major food stuffs broken out by county, state, and region, dating back deep into the 20th century. There is also census data on variety of other agriculture-related topics on land usage, expenses, income, energy usage.
https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/quick-stats-agricultural-database

There are over 50 million rows and 17 columns. When I filter to solely data in the Field Crops, Fruit & Tree Nuts, and Vegetable Groups available at the county level, there are about 7.5 million observations.

National Centers for Environmental Information
Supposedly, there is data on climate data (rain fall, temperatures, disasters) but the website says it is currently down due to the flooding in Asheville, NC. So Iâ€™ve been able to fully examine it but I will try to acquire data like this if it is not available soon.

## Project Description
I'd like to make a single map of the midwest region with considerable interactivity to display how features (such as crop production, area planted, and crop yieds) have changed over time along with average climate features. This would fall under the Option A category outlined in the interactive project description. 

### Examples

1) https://especiales.eldiario.es/spain-lives-in-flats/

I really like the linear narrative of this projection. I want my own to be able to still have a linear approach but keep my map of the midwest central to it. I would like my project to be able to zoom in and out of the map and present supporting evidence. I think this fits within option A. 

2) https://www.mapbox.com/showcase/un-ocha

I like the ability of this graphic to highlight different regions in the map based on certain criteria. This one certainly must fit better with option A.

## Questions

1) I want to make a bit of a mix between two the examples I've shown. I like the narrative components the first example and how it jumps around the map using supplimentary graphs. But my question is how feasible will it be for me to do something like this?
