## What is your current goal? Has it changed since the proposal?

My current goal is provide users with a tool to explore how agricultural production and climate have changed across the midwest in the past 50 years. Plan to do this through interactive maps but without the scrollytelling components I outlined in my proposal due to time constraints. 

## Are there data challenges you are facing? Are you currently depending on mock data?

No data changes since I cleaned all my data and put it in a database for my static project.

## Walk us through an interaction, either in words or you can record a quick 2-3 minute video.

One of my interactions is available by clicking on a county on the map. Several events are triggered when this happens. When a county is clicked, this triggers a zoom into the region of that county. The county is also highlighted. The county information box is then populated with data about the county. A user can then zoom out with their mouse or pan around the map to look at and click on other counties.

## Include a _numbered_ list of questions for us to respond to.

1. I am going to incorporate additional data (like climate factors and yield info). I am considering using a drop down so the chlorpleth can toggle between the types of data. Do you think it would be best use another map so the user will be better able to compare difference sets of data between two maps?

2. What do you think about including the grey background of other states as  a reference point? Is this helpful or confusing?

3. Not a question but I still have a lot of style/formating work to do so just fyi.
