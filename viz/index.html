The author grants you a license to use this template under the conditions:

    1) You MUST remove the tutorial comments.
       I recommend doing so as you read/understand them.
    2) You SHOULD make an attempt to customize this, 
       it's in everyone's best interest that you work to make
       your final product visually distinct.

There are two ways to get started w/ an HTML project:

- You can pick a complex template that already has lots of content and pare it
  down/adapt it to your needs. (Think woodcarving.)
- You can start with a simple template and only add what you need. (Think LEGO.)

I prefer to build up, but if you pick a more complex starting template the process won't differ much.
You'll just have more to potentially remove, and you'll still do a bit of building.

In the case of this template, I went to this page <https://bulma.io/documentation/start/overview/>
and took the 20-line HTML template that they offer.

This template links to the Bulma CSS file on a CDN, Content Delivery Network.
This is a service that hosts commonly used CSS and JS libraries. For final deployment, we will probably want to stop
using this in favor of our own copy of Bulma/D3/etc. but that can wait.

      Additional HTML and CSS would go here in the <head>.
    
      Either using links as seen above, or with <style></style> for inline CSS.
      
      Inline <script> tags often go in the body, so that the elements that they
      reference already exist.
      It is possible to have your code wait for the HTML to load before running as well,
      but this is a simpler approach.

      See the <script> tag at the bottom of this page for more detail.

    <!-- This script tag is at the very bottom of the body so that it can reference all of the HTML on the page.

         As mentioned above you can also keep all of your code inside a special event handler that fires after the page loads:

          document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function(event) { 
            // everything in here
          });

        Here, I load the helper functions first, so they will be available
        for main.js to use.  This is different from Python where files need
        to import one another.  JS does have that idea, but it is more than
        you need for single file apps like this one.
